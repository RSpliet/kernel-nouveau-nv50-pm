	  Feather-Trace basic tracing infrastructure. Includes device file
	  driver and instrumentation point support.

	  There are actually two implementations of Feather-Trace.
	  1) A slower, but portable, default implementation.
	  2) Architecture-specific implementations that rewrite kernel .text at runtime.

	  If enabled, Feather-Trace will be based on 2) if available (currently only for x86).
	  However, if DEBUG_RODATA=y, then Feather-Trace will choose option 1) in any case
	  to avoid problems with write-protected .text pages.

	  Bottom line: to avoid increased overheads, choose DEBUG_RODATA=n.

	  Note that this option only enables the basic Feather-Trace infrastructure;
	  you still need to enable SCHED_TASK_TRACE and/or SCHED_OVERHEAD_TRACE to
	  actually enable any events.
